Here’s a quick look at time complexities for **Lists**:

| **Operation**       | **Examples**       | **Average Case** | **Worst Case**    |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Append              | `l.append(item)`  | O(1)             | O(1) (resize)     |
| Indexing            | `l[i]`            | O(1)             | O(1)             |
| Containment         | `item in l`       | O(N)             | O(N)             |
